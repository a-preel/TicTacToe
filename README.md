Project Description
This project is a graphical implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 board until one of the players wins or the game ends in a draw.

Installation
To run the game locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
shell
Copy code
$ git clone https://github.com/a-preel/TicTacToe.git
$ cd TicTacToe
Make sure you have Python installed. This project was developed using Python 3.

Install the required libraries. Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.

Run the game:

ruby
Copy code
$ python TicTacToe.py
Usage
Upon running the game, a window will open displaying the Tic Tac Toe board.

Choose the game mode by clicking either "Single Player" or "Multiplayer" button. In the "Single Player" mode, you will play against the computer, and in the "Multiplayer" mode, you can play against a friend.

Click on the cells of the board to place your X or O.

The game will alternate between X and O until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

To restart the game at any time, click the "New Game" button.

Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 (X) goes first and Player 2 (O) goes second.
Players take turns placing their symbols on an empty cell.
The game ends when either one of the players completes a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
